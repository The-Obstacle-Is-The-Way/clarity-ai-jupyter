Clarity-AI Jupyter Repository Audit (MODMA EEG Sandbox)

Strengths and What’s Working Well
	•	Complete EEG Workflow Implementation: The codebase provides an end-to-end pipeline for depression classification using MODMA EEG data. It includes data loading, thorough preprocessing (channel selection, band-pass filtering 1–40 Hz, and 50 Hz notch filtering) and optional ICA-based artifact removal ￼ ￼. The pipeline then segments the continuous EEG into fixed-length epochs (2-second windows with 50% overlap) for feature extraction ￼ ￼. This matches standard EEG preprocessing practices, ensuring the data fed into models is clean and properly segmented.
	•	Robust Feature Extraction: Multiple feature representations are supported. For the CNN baseline, raw epoch windows (with 29 selected channels) are used directly. For the Vision Transformer (ViT) approach, each EEG epoch is converted into a 3-channel spectrogram image (224×224) via STFT ￼ ￼. For the GCN model, the code extracts per-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features (15 features per channel) and computes an adjacency matrix based on inter-channel correlations ￼ ￼. These features align with recent research (e.g. differential entropy, wavelet coefficients, connectivity graphs) and provide rich input for the models ￼ ￼. The inclusion of these diverse feature modalities indicates the repository is scientifically on-track with state-of-the-art EEG analysis techniques.
	•	Multiple Model Architectures: The sandbox implements several deep learning models ready for experimentation. A simple BaselineCNN offers a starting point, and a more specialized EEGNet (a compact CNN architecture popular in EEG research) has been added as a stronger baseline ￼ ￼. The MHA_GCN model combines graph convolution layers (via PyTorch Geometric) with a multi-head attention mechanism ￼ ￼, reflecting advanced graph-based approaches in literature. There’s also a Spectrogram ViT path leveraging the timm library for pre-trained vision transformers ￼. Each model is cleanly integrated: the training loop uses a model_type flag to route data preparation and model invocation appropriately (CNN and ViT get tensor inputs, GCN uses graph Data objects) ￼ ￼. This modular design makes it easy to extend or swap models, and ensures the workflow can explore a range of architectures.
	•	Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) Pipeline: The analysis is structured around LOOCV across the 53 subjects, which is a rigorous evaluation strategy for this dataset ￼. The notebook script iterates over subjects, using one as test while training on all others, and aggregates performance. This gives a detailed per-subject assessment and maximizes use of the small sample size. The code provides feedback for each fold and then computes aggregate metrics. By default, results include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (macro-averaged) for the multi-class task ￼. The audit-driven improvements have added collection of all predictions and labels across folds, enabling the construction of an overall confusion matrix ￼. This offers deeper insight into model behavior across classes (e.g. which depression levels get confused) rather than just average accuracy. Overall, the evaluation design is solid and in line with best practices for research-grade performance reporting.
	•	Caching and Efficiency: A major strength introduced is the caching mechanism to speed up experimentation. Expensive steps like EEG preprocessing and epoch segmentation are now cached on disk per subject ￼ ￼. The CustomEEGDataset class checks for a cached pickle before reprocessing a subject’s data ￼, which avoids redundant computation during LOOCV (since each subject’s data is loaded many times across folds). This dramatically improves efficiency for iterative experimentation. The use of tqdm progress bars in data loading ￼ and informative printouts (e.g. when ICA components are removed or when cache is used) gives the user transparency into the pipeline’s progress ￼ ￼. Together, these enhancements make the workflow much more scalable and researcher-friendly, reducing wait times and emphasizing reproducibility.
	•	Reproducible and Well-Documented Setup: The repository is organized as a Python package (clarity module under src/), which enforces a clean structure. Configuration is centralized in a single config.py (for dataset paths, constants, and hyperparameters), making it easy to adjust settings or find parameters ￼ ￼. The environment setup instructions in the README are clear and emphasize reproducibility: a requirements.lock.txt is provided with pinned versions for a stable setup ￼. The code consistently seeds random number generators for numpy, torch, etc., to ensure consistent results across runs ￼. Documentation is a strong point: the README outlines expected results for each model (e.g. accuracy ranges of 60–80% with advanced models at the upper end) and cites key research references that underpin the methods ￼ ￼. In the notebook/script, markdown headers and comments explain each step of the process (from LOOCV procedure to what each model represents), which greatly aids understandability. This level of clarity and documentation means new users can quickly grasp the purpose of each component and trust the environment to be consistent with published results.

Gaps and Impactful Missing Components

Despite the overall robustness, a few gaps or fragile areas remain that could affect experimentation:
	•	Label Handling (Ground Truth): The most significant gap is the handling of depression labels. Currently, the code uses a placeholder mapping of subjects to randomly generated BDI scores (Beck Depression Inventory II) for demonstration ￼. While the structure exists for multi-class severity labels (5 classes mapped from BDI ranges) ￼ ￼, the actual dataset’s labels (e.g. clinical depression scores or diagnoses) are not integrated. This means out-of-the-box runs won’t reflect real outcomes. Relying on dummy labels is acceptable for code testing, but before serious experiments, the real labels from MODMA must be plugged in (likely via a provided score sheet or metadata in the dataset). Until that is done, any classification results are not scientifically meaningful. This is a preparedness issue: the code is label-ready, but not yet using real data – a user might mistakenly run experiments on random labels if not careful.
	•	Multimodal Integration (Speech/Other Modalities): The project’s scope is primarily EEG, and there is no active processing of any modality beyond EEG in the current code. The MODMA dataset is described as multi-modal, possibly including audio (speech recordings) or other data, and the repository even includes dependencies like torchaudio and references to multimodal research ￼. However, at present there are no data loaders or pipelines for audio or other modalities, nor any combined model that fuses EEG with another modality. This is only a gap relative to the “multimodal” ambition: it doesn’t hinder EEG experimentation, but it means the “digital twin” isn’t yet fully realized across modalities. Any planned speech or video analysis components remain to be implemented, so the codebase is not yet exploring those channels.
	•	Preprocessing Edge Cases: The EEG preprocessing could be documented or configured a bit more for edge conditions. For example, the code skips the 50 Hz notch filter if a recording has fewer than 2000 samples (treated as a “short signal”) ￼ ￼, assuming it’s test data. While this is a sensible guard (perhaps to handle very short trial recordings or artifacts), it’s a somewhat ad-hoc criterion that might not generalize if a genuine recording is short. Additionally, the channel selection focuses on 29 channels aligned to 10–20 system ￼ – this is clearly documented and based on prior studies, but if a user wanted to use all 128 channels or a different subset, they would have to manually modify the config. There’s no dynamic detection of bad channels or re-referencing step (e.g., common average reference), which some EEG practitioners might expect. These aren’t critical flaws – the current choices are reasonable defaults – but they represent potential fragility if different data conditions are encountered (e.g. missing channels or noisy electrodes not removed by ICA).
	•	Resource Utilization (Memory/Speed): The improvement with caching greatly speeds up LOOCV, but memory usage should be noted. The CustomEEGDataset holds all processed epochs for the selected subjects in memory (self.data list of epochs/graphs) ￼ ￼. For 53 subjects with overlapping windows, this is manageable (each epoch is not huge), but if the dataset grew or if one attempted a different cross-validation (like k-fold with larger folds), memory could become a consideration. The GCN data preparation is particularly heavy: it creates graph data by sliding a window of 180 epochs (~6 minutes of EEG) and computing features, which could result in thousands of graph samples for each training fold ￼ ￼. It’s efficient per subject, but the total number of graph objects might be large. In practice, this seems to run within feasible limits, but it’s something to watch. The code does not currently implement any on-the-fly loading or mini-batch preprocessing (everything is precomputed), so peak memory usage occurs upfront. As long as hardware has sufficient RAM and the dataset remains of this scale, it’s fine – just an area to be mindful of when scaling up.
	•	Results Logging and Comparison: While the notebook prints metrics and can plot a confusion matrix, there isn’t a built-in logging to file or advanced experiment tracking. For a sandbox, this is usually fine; the user can manually note results or extend the notebook. The audit suggested statistical significance testing between models (e.g. paired t-tests on LOOCV fold accuracies) ￼ ￼ – this is a valuable addition for research rigor, and a plan for it exists, but it may not yet be fully implemented in the current notebook. Similarly, visualization of the GCN’s learned graph attention was proposed (returning attention weights, which the model now does, and plotting them) ￼ ￼. If these pieces are not present, the analysis might miss some insights (e.g. which model is significantly better, or what the GCN is focusing on). These are nice-to-have extras rather than fundamental flaws, but they do impact how easily a researcher can interpret and compare results using the tool as-is.

Recommended High-Leverage Action Items

Based on the above gaps, here are the key action items that would most improve the repository’s readiness and reliability:
	1.	Integrate Real Labels: Replace the placeholder BDI_SCORES in config.py with actual subject labels from the MODMA dataset. This likely means importing a CSV or JSON of subject depression scores or categories. Then, populate the labels_dict in the notebook using those scores mapped through the provided DEPRESSION_LEVELS ranges ￼ ￼. Impact: This is essential – it will turn the experiments from a toy demo into a valid scientific exploration, ensuring model performance metrics correspond to real clinical labels.
	2.	Double-Check Multi-Class Setup: Ensure that all models and loss functions are aligned with the 5-class classification task. In particular, verify that the final layer of each model outputs 5 logits and that the loss (criterion) is nn.CrossEntropyLoss (suitable for multi-class). The code already updated NUM_CLASSES = 5 in config ￼ ￼, but it’s worth confirming model initialization arguments. Impact: Prevents subtle bugs where a model might still be set for binary output or the evaluation metrics might be using wrong assumptions. Given the audit changes, this is likely done, but a quick review ensures no component is inadvertently treating it as binary.
	3.	Add Label Data Checks: Implement a sanity check when creating the labels_dict or loading data – for example, print a brief summary of label distribution (how many subjects per class) at the start. This will immediately reveal if the labels are being read correctly (and not all zeros or random). Impact: In a research setting, this reduces the chance of mislabeling going unnoticed and gives confidence that the classification task is set up properly each run.
	4.	Verify and Document MODMA Data Requirements: Clearly note in the README (or notebook) the required structure and contents of the MODMA dataset (e.g. “each subject should have a subXX/rest.set file, plus a corresponding label in XYZ file”). While the README does mention the expected folder structure for EEG files ￼, it would help to also mention how to get the labels (since MODMA’s depression levels might come from a questionnaire like PHQ-9 or BDI-II). If the dataset providers gave a file of scores, instruct the user to place or link it so the code can ingest it. Impact: Enhances reproducibility and ease-of-use – new users won’t be confused about where the ground truth comes from or how to include it.
	5.	Multimodal Extension (If Planned): If incorporating other modalities (e.g. speech audio) is a near-term goal, consider scaffolding a basic pipeline for it. For instance, provide a placeholder function to load audio data (if available) and an example of extracting features (like MFCCs or spectrograms) or using a pre-trained audio model. This could be as simple as a note or TODO in the code where such data would fit. If multimodal fusion is intended (combining EEG and audio), outline the approach (early fusion vs. late fusion) in the documentation. Impact: This doesn’t need full implementation now (which could add complexity), but having the structure or plan in place will make future expansion easier and signals to users what’s coming. It also justifies the inclusion of libraries like torchaudio and ensures they’ll be utilized.
	6.	Enhance Results Analysis (Optional but Useful): Implement the planned statistical comparison and GCN visualization once the primary modeling is working. For example, run LOOCV for at least two models (Baseline vs. GCN) and perform the paired t-test as outlined ￼ ￼, outputting the p-value to indicate if one model significantly outperforms the other. Also, use the attn_weights returned by MHA_GCN.forward() ￼ ￼ to plot an average attention matrix or graph connectivity for a given class or subject. These additions will give the sandbox a more “research publication” feel – highlighting not just what model wins but whether it’s statistically significant and what patterns it learns. Impact: Provides deeper insights and makes the tool more educational. That said, if time or scope is limited, these can be added in later, as they don’t affect the core functionality.

Importantly, each of the above should be implemented only to the point of clear benefit. For example, if adding audio will over-complicate the code without immediate use, simply leave it out for now (or keep the codebase focused on EEG until there’s a concrete need). The emphasis should remain on making the EEG experimentation as seamless and informative as possible.

Multimodal Elements (Audio) Status

Currently, the repository does not yet include any fully implemented multimodal features beyond EEG. All analysis and models are EEG-centric. The inclusion of torchaudio in the environment and a cited reference on multimodal GCN+Transformer research ￼ suggest the authors envisioned incorporating audio (speech) or other modalities from the MODMA dataset. However, as of now there is no code to load or process non-EEG data, nor integration of audio features into the models. If the MODMA dataset provides, say, interview recordings or other biometric signals, those are not utilized in this sandbox yet.

On the positive side, the code structure could accommodate extensions: e.g., one could imagine adding a new data loading function and perhaps a parallel model branch for audio. The Vision Transformer approach in the code hints at how one might treat another modality – by converting it into a format suitable for a deep model (for audio, possibly spectrogram images or using pre-trained audio embeddings). In short, the groundwork (libraries, references) for multimodal work is present, but the implementation is pending. For now, users should consider the repo as EEG-only. Any multimodal experiments would require additional coding (which the maintainers have deferred, likely to avoid complexity until it’s truly needed).

Ready for Experimentation? – Conclusion

Overall, the repository is very close to “ready” for rigorous experimentation on EEG-based depression classification. The strengths in design, documentation, and recent enhancements mean that a researcher can clone the repo, install the environment, load the data, and run through a full analysis with relative ease. The core pieces – data preprocessing, feature engineering, diverse models, and evaluation – are all in place and functioning well. Assuming the user supplies the actual MODMA dataset and inserts the real labels, the code should produce meaningful results out-of-the-box (the README even provides expected performance ranges to verify against ￼).

The remaining steps to consider the sandbox truly experiment-ready are mostly housekeeping: integrating the real ground truth labels and perhaps tidying up a few minor issues (as noted above). These are not major developmental undertakings, but rather final calibration tweaks. Once the labels are in and any final checks done, the notebook can be run in full to train and compare models, visualize outcomes like confusion matrices, and even test new ideas (thanks to the modular structure).

In summary, the Clarity-AI Jupyter repository is well-prepared for deep EEG experimentation on MODMA. It demonstrates a strong foundation with only small gaps to close. By addressing the label integration and polishing a couple of analysis features, the repository will be fully “ready” for sandbox exploration – enabling reliable, insightful experiments in EEG-based mental health modeling without undue setup or troubleshooting. The focus on clarity and minimal complexity has paid off: users can concentrate on science (e.g. trying new model tweaks or interpreting results) rather than debugging the pipeline. With this solid base, the project can confidently be used for learning and research, and it provides an excellent platform to incorporate any future multimodal expansions when the need arises.
