How you’ll typically handle pre-trained weights in this project

Short answer:
Yes—once you have the .pt/.pth (PyTorch) files you simply import the matching architecture from clarity.models, instantiate it, and call model.load_state_dict(torch.load(<path>)) inside a notebook or a small utility script.

Below is the long-form “professional” workflow so you can drop the weights in and keep everything tidy and reproducible.

⸻

1. Decide where the weight files live

Option What to do Pros / Cons
checkpoints/ folder in the repo (but ignored by git) 1. mkdir -p checkpoints  2. add the line checkpoints/ to .gitignore Fast & local, but everyone on the team needs to copy them manually or via a secure file-share.
Cloud/object storage (S3, GCS, etc.) Keep a small YAML/JSON that maps a friendly name → signed URL. Good for large files and CI; a bit more infra work.
Weights & Biases / MLflow artifact store Track experiments and pull checkpoints through the SDK. Great audit trail; adds SaaS dependency.

Pick whichever matches how you’ll collaborate. Most teams start with a local checkpoints/ dir and graduate to cloud later.

2. Naming convention

Use something predictable so code can auto-discover:

checkpoints/
    mha_gcn_modma_fold_00.pt
    mha_gcn_modma_fold_01.pt
    vit_speech_pretrained.pt

If you’re doing LOOCV, save one file per fold, or save a single final model retrained on the full training set.

3. Loading in a Jupyter notebook

from pathlib import Path
import torch

# ➊ Instantiate architecture with **exact** hyper-params used to train

from clarity.models.mha_gcn import MHAGCN

NODE_FEATURES = 2700          # 15 × 180 in your design
model = MHAGCN(node_feature_dim=NODE_FEATURES)
model.eval()

# ➋ Load the checkpoint

ckpt_path = Path("../checkpoints/mha_gcn_modma_fold_00.pt")
state = torch.load(ckpt_path, map_location="cpu")   # or "cuda"
model.load_state_dict(state)

# ➌ Use it

with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(node_feats_batch, adj_batch)     # whatever loader returns
    probs  = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

Why map_location="cpu"?
It still works on a GPU session (model.to("cuda") afterwards) and avoids problems if the file was saved on a different device.

4. When the weights come from other researchers
 1. Check architecture parity
 • If their repo uses different layer sizes / activation order you’ll need to port those changes into clarity.models or write an adapter that renames keys in the state_dict.
 2. Check PyTorch version
 • If the file was produced with a much older/newer Torch you might see pickle errors. A quick pip install "torch==X.Y.Z" inside your virtual-env usually fixes it.
 3. License & EULA
 • Weights trained directly on MODMA data are derivative of the dataset. Under the MODMA EULA you may distribute trained models in published papers and academic code as long as no raw data is embedded and you credit the dataset. Commercial redistribution is prohibited.
Rule of thumb: keep the checkpoint private until you know the legal status, or host it in a private bucket with restricted access.

⸻

5. Automate it (optional)

Create a tiny helper in clarity/utils/weights.py:

import torch
from importlib import resources  # Python 3.9+

def load_checkpoint(model, name: str):
    """
    Args:
        model: an nn.Module instance.
        name: e.g. "mha_gcn_modma_fold_00"
    """
    from pathlib import Path
    ckpt = Path(**file**).parent.parent / "checkpoints" / f"{name}.pt"
    state = torch.load(ckpt, map_location="cpu")
    model.load_state_dict(state)
    return model

Then your notebook does:

from clarity.models import mha_gcn
from clarity.utils.weights import load_checkpoint

model = mha_gcn.MHAGCN(node_feature_dim=2700)
model = load_checkpoint(model, "mha_gcn_modma_fold_00").to("cuda")

⸻

6. Unit-test that a checkpoint loads

Add a quick PyTest:

# tests/test_checkpoint_load.py

import torch
from clarity.models.mha_gcn import MHAGCN
from clarity.utils.weights import load_checkpoint

def test_mha_checkpoint_loads():
    model = MHAGCN(node_feature_dim=2700)
    model = load_checkpoint(model, "mha_gcn_modma_fold_00")
    assert isinstance(model, MHAGCN)
    # optional: pass a random tensor through to ensure shapes line up
    dummy_x  = torch.rand(1, 29, 2700)
    dummy_adj = torch.eye(29).unsqueeze(0)
    _= model(dummy_x, dummy_adj)

Run with pytest -q—if it passes, you know the weights and code match.

⸻

TL;DR
 1. Put the .pt files in an ignored checkpoints/ directory or a cloud bucket.
 2. In the notebook: instantiate the same architecture, call load_state_dict.
 3. (Nice to have) wrap that in a helper and write a one-line PyTest so you never worry about mismatch again.
