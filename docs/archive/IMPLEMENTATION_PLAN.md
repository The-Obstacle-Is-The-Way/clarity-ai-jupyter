# Clarity EEG Analysis: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to enhance the `clarity-ai-jupyter` repository based on a comprehensive code audit. The goal is to evolve this research sandbox into a best-in-class platform for EEG-based depression analysis.

The recommendations from the audit have been synthesized with the current state of the codebase and are broken down into the following detailed implementation plans. Each file contains a checklist of actionable tasks, detailed instructions, and the rationale for each change.

## Implementation Modules

Please review and implement the tasks in the following documents in the recommended order:

1.  [**Module 1: Preprocessing Enhancements**](./1_PREPROCESSING_ENHANCEMENTS.md)
    *   Focuses on refining and validating the existing data preprocessing pipeline to ensure scientific rigor.

2.  [**Module 2: Workflow and Efficiency**](./2_WORKFLOW_AND_EFFICIENCY.md)
    *   Addresses the critical performance bottleneck in the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) loop and improves the overall development workflow.

3.  [**Module 3: Model Enhancements**](./3_MODEL_ENHANCEMENTS.md)
    *   Expands the repository's modeling capabilities by adding new baseline and state-of-the-art models, and improving existing ones.

4.  [**Module 4: Results and Visualization**](./4_RESULTS_AND_VISUALIZATION.md)
    *   Improves the analysis and interpretation of model results with better visualizations and statistical validation.

5.  [**Module 5: Documentation and Reproducibility**](./5_DOCUMENTATION_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY.md)
    *   Enhances documentation, environment stability, and overall project reproducibility.

Let's begin with Module 1.
