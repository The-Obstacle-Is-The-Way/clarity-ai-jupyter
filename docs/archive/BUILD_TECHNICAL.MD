### **2. Data Handling - End-to-End** üîÑ

* **Raw EEG Data Loading (MODMA)**:
    * **Loading a single subject**:
        ```python
        import mne
        # Assuming subject_id is like 'subj01', 'subj02', ...
        # Path needs to be verified against actual MODMA dataset structure after download.
        # The MODMA paper mentions 53 participants for 128-channel EEG. [cite: 5]
        # BUILD_TECHNICAL.MD gives an example: raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif("../data/128EEG/subj01_raw.fif", preload=True)
        file_path = f"{DATA_DIR}/128EEG/{subject_id}_raw.fif" # Adjust if naming differs
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            # Fallback if .fif isn't directly available, may need conversion from .set or other formats
            # e.g., file_path = f"{DATA_DIR}/EEG_128channel_resting/{subject_id}/rest.set"
            # raw = mne.io.read_raw_eeglab(file_path, preload=True)
            print(f"Warning: {file_path} not found. Placeholder logic for loading.")
            # This part needs to be robust to the actual file structure and format in MODMA
            # For now, assuming .fif files are present as per BT example for simplicity.
            return None 
        raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(file_path, preload=True)
        ```
    * **Channel Selection**:
        ```python
        CHANNELS_29 = ['F7', 'F3', 'Fz', 'F4', 'F8', 'T7', 'C3', 'Cz', 'C4', 
                        'T8', 'P7', 'P3', 'Pz', 'P4', 'P8', 'O1', 'O2', 'Fpz', 
                        'F9', 'FT9', 'FT10', 'TP9', 'TP10', 'PO9', 'PO10', 'Iz', 
                        'A1', 'A2', 'POz'] # BO, Section 1
        # Verify CHANNELS_29 are present in raw.info['ch_names'] and handle potential discrepancies.
        # Some datasets might use 'FPz' instead of 'Fpz', or 'I' instead of 'Iz'.
        # A1, A2 are often reference channels. If they are not data channels, they might need to be handled differently (e.g., set as reference if not already, or dropped if not used).
        # For MODMA, it's important to check how A1/A2 are used. Assuming they are standard data channels for now as listed.
        
        # Create a mapping for potential differences if necessary, e.g.:
        channel_mapping = {'Fpz': 'FPz', 'Iz': 'I1'} # Example based on common variations
        mapped_channels_29 = []
        missing_channels = []
        for ch in CHANNELS_29:
            if ch in raw.ch_names:
                mapped_channels_29.append(ch)
            elif ch in channel_mapping and channel_mapping[ch] in raw.ch_names:
                mapped_channels_29.append(channel_mapping[ch])
            else:
                # Attempt to find A1/A2 if they are Mastoids (M1/M2)
                if ch == 'A1' and 'M1' in raw.ch_names: mapped_channels_29.append('M1')
                elif ch == 'A2' and 'M2' in raw.ch_names: mapped_channels_29.append('M2')
                else: missing_channels.append(ch)
        
        if missing_channels:
            print(f"Warning: The following specified channels were not found and could not be mapped: {missing_channels}")
            print(f"Available channels: {raw.ch_names}")
            # Decide on a strategy: error out, or proceed with available channels.
            # For now, proceed with successfully mapped/found channels.

        raw.pick_channels(mapped_channels_29, ordered=False) # Use only successfully found/mapped channels
        ```
    * **Iterating through subjects**:
        ```python
        # Assuming subject IDs are subj01, subj02, ..., subj53
        # This list would ideally be sourced from the MODMA dataset's participant list.
        # The MODMA paper states 53 participants for the 128-electrode EEG. [cite: 5]
        subject_ids = [f"subj{i:02d}" for i in range(1, 54)] 
        all_subject_data = []
        for subj_id in subject_ids:
            # raw_data = load_and_select_channels_for_subject(subj_id) # Using a combined function
            # if raw_data:
            #     all_subject_data.append(raw_data)
            pass # Placeholder for actual loop logic
        ```

* **Speech Data Processing (for MHA-GCN\_ViT)**:
    * The MODMA dataset includes spoken language data. [cite: 3, 7]
    * The MHA-GCN ViT paper uses STFT to extract Mel spectrograms from speech. [cite: 232, 249]
    * **STFT Parameters for Speech Mel Spectrograms** (Typical values, paper may have specifics not detailed here):
        * `SAMPLING_RATE_SPEECH`: Typically 16000 Hz or higher for speech. Need to verify MODMA speech data's sampling rate.
        * `FRAME_SIZE`: e.g., 25ms. `frame_length = int(SAMPLING_RATE_SPEECH * 0.025)`
        * `FRAME_STRIDE` (overlap): e.g., 10ms. `frame_step = int(SAMPLING_RATE_SPEECH * 0.010)`
        * `WINDOW_TYPE`: 'hann'
        * `NFFT`: Next power of 2 from `frame_length`, e.g., 512 or 1024.
        * `NUM_MEL_BINS`: e.g., 80 or 128.
        * Use `librosa.feature.melspectrogram` or `torchaudio.transforms.MelSpectrogram`.
    * **Preparation for ViT**:
        * Resize spectrogram to 224x224 pixels (MHA-GCN ViT Paper, Section 4.2). [cite: 232] This might involve interpolation.
        * Normalization: Typically to \[0, 1] or mean 0, std 1.
    * **Synchronization/Pairing**:
        * MODMA contains EEG and audio from the same participants. [cite: 3] The dataset structure documentation will be crucial to link a specific EEG file/segment to its corresponding audio file/segment for each subject. Often, this is done by participant ID and session/task identifiers. Assume files are named or structured to allow this pairing.

* **Preprocessing Steps** (Applied per subject's 29-channel raw data):
    * **Bandpass filter**:
        ```python
        # BO, Section 4.2: 1-40 Hz. MHA-GCN ViT Paper, Section 4.2: 0.5-45 Hz.
        # Let's use 1-40 Hz from BUILD_OVERVIEW.
        # MNE default is FIR filter. Butterworth can be specified if needed.
        low_cut = 1.0  # Hz
        high_cut = 40.0 # Hz
        raw.filter(l_freq=low_cut, h_freq=high_cut, fir_design='firwin', verbose=False)
        ```
    * **ICA for artifact removal**:
        ```python
        # BO, Section 4.2
        # MHA-GCN ViT Paper, Section 4.2 mentions ICA but no specific parameters.
        # Suggestion:
        n_components_ica = 20 # Or len(raw.ch_names) - 1, or a fixed number like 20-25.
                              # Needs to be less than or equal to number of channels.
        ica = mne.preprocessing.ICA(n_components=n_components_ica, method='fastica', random_state=42, max_iter='auto')
        ica.fit(raw)
        
        # Identifying artifactual ICs (example: EOG and ECG):
        # This usually requires EOG/ECG channels or heuristics.
        # If dedicated EOG/ECG channels are available:
        # ica.exclude = []
        # eog_indices, eog_scores = ica.find_bads_eog(raw, ch_name=['EOG_H', 'EOG_V']) # Example ch_names
        # ica.exclude.extend(eog_indices)
        # ecg_indices, ecg_scores = ica.find_bads_ecg(raw, ch_name='ECG') # Example ch_name
        # ica.exclude.extend(ecg_indices)
        
        # If no EOG/ECG channels, use heuristics (more complex, e.g., based on IC properties like spatial distribution or time course)
        # For simplicity, if no EOG/ECG, one might skip automatic detection or manually inspect ICs for a few subjects to set heuristics.
        # Assuming a basic approach for now. If specific EOG/ECG channels were part of the 128 channels, they should be identified.
        # Often, a common approach is to find ICs correlated with EOG/ECG channels if present.
        # If not, visual inspection or automated methods based on spectral properties or spatial maps are used.
        # As a placeholder:
        # Find ICs correlating with Fpz (often captures eye blinks if no dedicated EOG)
        # Fpz_idx = raw.ch_names.index('Fpz') if 'Fpz' in raw.ch_names else (raw.ch_names.index('FPz') if 'FPz' in raw.ch_names else -1)
        # if Fpz_idx != -1:
        #    eog_indices, eog_scores = ica.find_bads_eog(raw, ch_name=raw.ch_names[Fpz_idx])
        #    if eog_indices: ica.exclude = eog_indices
        # else:
        #    print("Warning: Fpz channel not found for EOG artifact detection.")
        
        # For now, let's assume a number of components are removed (e.g., first 1-2 if they capture gross artifacts)
        # This step ideally requires more domain knowledge or visual inspection setup.
        # For a truly automatic pipeline without dedicated EOG/ECG channels, this is a challenging step.
        # A common placeholder if no other info: remove components with typical artifact signatures (e.g. very low frequency drift, or strong frontal activity for blinks)
        # For this blueprint, let's assume a manual or semi-automatic IC selection process is abstracted.
        # If ica.exclude is not set, no components will be removed by default.
        # Alternative: Use an automated method like 'autoreject' or MNE's automatic EOG/ECG detection if channels available.

        ica.apply(raw)
        ```
    * **Segmentation**:
        ```python
        # BO, Section 4.2: 2-second windows with 50% overlap
        # SAMPLING_RATE = 250 Hz (BO, Section 1)
        window_duration = 2.0  # seconds
        window_overlap_ratio = 0.5 # BO, Section 1
        
        # MHA-GCN ViT Paper (Section 4.2) also uses 2-s epochs with 50% overlap.
        epochs = mne.make_fixed_length_epochs(raw, duration=window_duration, overlap=window_duration * window_overlap_ratio, preload=True, verbose=False)
        # epochs.get_data() will return a 3D numpy array: (n_epochs, n_channels, n_times)
        ```

### **3. Detailed Feature Extraction Implementation** üî¨

* **Differential Entropy (DE)**:
    * Formula: `DE = 0.5 * np.log(2 * np.pi * np.e * psd_data)` (BO, Section 2.A).
    * `psd_data` calculation per 2s window, per channel, per band:
        ```python
        # FREQ_BANDS from BO, Section 1
        # SAMPLING_RATE = 250 Hz
        def calculate_psd_de_features(epoch_data, sfreq, freq_bands, window_size_sec=2):
            # epoch_data: (n_channels, n_times_in_window)
            # e.g., n_times_in_window = sfreq * window_size_sec = 250 * 2 = 500
            
            n_channels, n_times = epoch_data.shape
            de_features_bands = np.zeros((n_channels, len(freq_bands)))
            psd_features_bands = np.zeros((n_channels, len(freq_bands)))

            for band_idx, (band_name, (low_freq, high_freq)) in enumerate(freq_bands.items()):
                # Welch's method for PSD
                # nperseg: length of each segment for Welch. Can be n_times for shorter windows, or a fraction.
                # For 2s window (500 samples), nperseg could be 250 or 500.
                # If using MNE:
                # psds, freqs = mne.time_frequency.psd_welch(epoch_data_mne_format, fmin=low_freq, fmax=high_freq, ...)
                # Using scipy.signal.welch:
                freqs, psd = scipy.signal.welch(epoch_data, fs=sfreq, nperseg=n_times, axis=-1) 
                                                # Using n_times means one segment per epoch for Welch's method, essentially periodogram.
                                                # Or use a smaller nperseg like 256 if desired.
                
                # Find PSD within the current band
                band_mask = (freqs >= low_freq) & (freqs <= high_freq)
                psd_in_band = psd[:, band_mask]
                
                # Calculate power in band (integral of PSD, approximated by sum)
                power_in_band = np.sum(psd_in_band, axis=-1) * (freqs[1] - freqs[0] if len(freqs) > 1 else 1) # (n_channels,)
                psd_features_bands[:, band_idx] = power_in_band
                
                # DE calculation: Add a small epsilon to prevent log(0) if power_in_band can be zero
                epsilon = 1e-10 
                de_features_bands[:, band_idx] = 0.5 * np.log(2 * np.pi * np.e * (power_in_band + epsilon))
                
            # Output: de_features_bands (n_channels, n_freq_bands)
            # Output: psd_features_bands (n_channels, n_freq_bands) for other uses if needed
            return de_features_bands 
        ```

* **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**:
    * Wavelet: 'db4', 5 decomposition levels using `pywt.wavedec` (BO, Section 2.B).
    * Features: mean, std, energy for each of the 5 levels (approx + detail coeffs) per channel. This results in (5 levels + 1 approx level) * 3 features = 18 features if we consider all. Or 5 levels of detail coefficients = 5*3 = 15 features. The BO says "5 decomposition levels... mean, std, energy for each level", suggesting 15 features.
    * **Critical - Output Shape for MHA-GCN**: The target output per 2s window is `[29_channels, 15_dwt_features, 180_time_steps]` as per MHA-GCN ViT Paper (Table 2, "EEG DWT features" footnote: "The DWT features extracted from each 2-s EEG epoch are represented as a tensor of 29 channels √ó 15 features (5 levels √ó 3 metrics: mean, std, energy) √ó 180 time steps. The '180 time steps' dimension is achieved by reshaping or selecting coefficients from the DWT output to form a fixed-length sequence for each feature type and channel from that single 2s epoch.").
        ```python
        import pywt
        import numpy as np

                # This likely means that for each of the 5 levels, we create a "time series" representation of its mean, std, and energy.
                # This might be done by taking sub-windows of the coefficients, or by a transformation.
                # If the goal is a feature vector of size 15*180 per node for GCN, one direct way is:
                # Calculate 15 scalar DWT features (mean, std, energy for 5 detail levels).

                # Or, the "180 time steps" refers to taking 180 consecutive 2s windows and stacking their 15 DWT features.

                # Let's follow the paper's phrasing closely: "reshaping or selecting coefficients...to form a fixed-length sequence"
                # For each level's coefficients (e.g., cD5), we need to derive 3 sequences of length 180.
                # This is difficult to interpret directly. Let's assume a more standard approach and note this as needing EXPERT CLARIFICATION.
                # Standard DWT features are scalar per window.
                # If 15*180 is truly the feature vector size per node from a single 2s window:
                # One possibility: the coefficients themselves are padded/truncated to 180 points, and then mean, std, energy are taken *over these 180 points*,
                # which would just be 3 scalars. This doesn't fit.

                # Alternative interpretation from MHA-GCN ViT paper table 2: "29 channels √ó 15 features √ó 180 time steps".
                # This means for each of the 15 feature types (e.g., mean of cD5, std of cD5, energy of cD5, mean of cD4...),
                # we have a sequence of 180 values.
                # How is a single mean/std/energy value turned into a sequence of 180?
                # Perhaps the DWT is applied to 180 sub-segments of the 2s window? Unlikely.
                # Or, features from 180 *different* 2s windows are stacked. This is more plausible for forming an input to a model that expects sequences.
                # If this is the case, then one "sample" for the MHA-GCN path consists of 180 consecutive (overlapping) 2s windows.

* **DepL_GCN Model/Modules** (BO, Section 3.B; DepL-GCN Paper):
    * **Base GCN**: This could be the `MHA_GCN` defined above, or a simpler GCN if MHA is specific to the MHA-GCN\_ViT model. The DepL-GCN paper proposes SSPA-GCN as a base but also mentions using GCN for depression level recognition. [cite: 59, 79] For this blueprint, let's assume a generic GCN structure (like the GCN part of MHA\_GCN before attention, or SSPA-GCN if its specifics are provided).
    * **`calculate_NeL2`**:
        * `eL2`: "L2-norm of prediction errors" (DepL-GCN Paper, Section III.C). This is $|| P_i - Y_i ||_2$, where $P_i$ is the predicted probability vector for sample $i$, and $Y_i$ is the one-hot true label vector.
            ```python
            def calculate_eL2(model_output_probs, true_one_hot_labels):
                # model_output_probs: [batch_size, num_classes]
                # true_one_hot_labels: [batch_size, num_classes]
                return torch.norm(model_output_probs - true_one_hot_labels, p=2, dim=1)
            ```
        * `LeL2`: "The L2-norm of the prediction error for each sample i in each epoch e is denoted as $eL_2(i,e)$. We maintain a record, $LeL_2(i,e)$, which stores the $eL_2(i,e)$ from epoch 1 to e for sample i." (DepL-GCN Paper, Section III.C). This means $LeL_2(i,e)$ is a list or array of $eL_2$ values for sample $i$ up to epoch $e$. The formula `NeL2 = LeL2 - u_rate * (LeL2 - eL2)` (DepL-GCN Paper, Eq. 5) implies `LeL2` in this formula is actually the *accumulated historical error norm up to the previous epoch* for that sample or an average/smoothed version. The paper states "average value of $eL_2(i,k)$ for sample $i$ from epoch 1 to $e-1$." This means $LeL_2(i,e) = \frac{1}{e-1} \sum_{k=1}^{e-1} eL_2(i,k)$. For the first epoch, $LeL_2$ could be initialized to $eL_2(i,1)$.
            * `LeL2_storage`: A dictionary or array mapping `sample_id` to a list of its `eL2` values over epochs.
            * In `calculate_NeL2(LeL2_historical_avg, current_eL2, u_rate=0.6)`:
                * `LeL2_historical_avg` is the average $eL_2$ for that sample up to the *previous* epoch.
                * `current_eL2` is the $eL_2$ for the current epoch.
        * `calculate_NeL2` function (BO, Section 3.B):
            ```python
            def calculate_NeL2(LeL2_historical_avg_prev_epoch, current_eL2_this_epoch, u_rate=0.6):
                # DepL-GCN Paper, Eq. 5
                return LeL2_historical_avg_prev_epoch - u_rate * (LeL2_historical_avg_prev_epoch - current_eL2_this_epoch)
            ```
    * **`minority_penalty`**:
        * `max(NeL2)`: "a statistical maximum that is set to approximately 80% of the theoretical maximum of $NeL_2$" (DepL-GCN Paper, Section III.D). The theoretical maximum of $eL_2$ (for probabilities vs one-hot) is $\sqrt{ (1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + \sum (0-0)^2 } = \sqrt{2}$ if num\_classes >= 2. $NeL_2$ is related to this.
            * **Practical implementation for `max(NeL2)`**: It could be dynamically estimated as the 80th percentile of $NeL_2$ values observed so far in the current epoch or a moving window, or a fixed value if the range of $NeL_2$ is somewhat stable. Using $0.8 \times \sqrt{2}$ might be a starting point if $NeL_2$ values are in a similar range to $eL_2$. Or, as the BO suggests, `max(NeL2)` could mean `torch.max(current_epoch_NeL2_values_for_minority_samples)`. The paper is a bit vague on "theoretical maximum of $NeL_2$". Given the formula uses `NeL2 / max(NeL2)`, it's a relative scaling. Let's assume `max_NeL2_val` is the maximum observed `NeL2` for minority samples in the current batch/epoch.
            ```python
            def minority_penalty_func(prediction_correct, is_minority_sample, NeL2_for_sample, max_NeL2_in_batch_minority):
                # BO, Section 3.B; DepL-GCN Paper, Eq. 6
                # Prediction is correct if prediction == true_label
                # The penalty applies if is_minority and prediction is WRONG.
                penalty = 0.0
                if is_minority_sample and not prediction_correct:
                    if max_NeL2_in_batch_minority > 1e-6: # Avoid division by zero
                         # The paper says "NeL2 / max(NeL2)". Here NeL2_for_sample is the NeL2 of the current misclassified minority sample.
                         # max_NeL2_in_batch_minority refers to the max NeL2 among all minority samples (or just misclassified ones).
                         # Let's assume it's the max NeL2 among all minority samples in the current context (e.g., batch).
                        penalty = NeL2_for_sample / max_NeL2_in_batch_minority
                    else: # if max_NeL2 is zero (e.g. all NeL2 are zero for minority samples)
                        penalty = NeL2_for_sample # or 1.0 if NeL2_for_sample > 0
                return penalty 
            ```
    * **Loss Function Modification** (DepL-GCN Paper, Section III.E, Eq. 7, 8):
        * The sample confidence $SC_i = 1 - NeL_2(i,e) / \text{max}(NeL_2(k,e))$ for $k \in \text{all samples}$.
        * The final weight for sample $i$ is $w_i = SC_i + MP_i$.
        * `WeightedCrossEntropyLoss_i = w_i * CrossEntropyLoss_i`.
        ```python
        class DepLCustomLoss(nn.Module):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                self.ce_loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none') # Get loss per sample

            def forward(self, model_outputs, true_labels_one_hot, true_labels_idx, NeL2_values,

                # SC_i = 1 - NeL2_i / max_NeL2_overall. Ensure max_NeL2_overall is not zero.
                safe_max_NeL2_all = max_NeL2_all_samples if max_NeL2_all_samples > 1e-6 else 1.0
                sample_confidence = 1.0 - (NeL2_values / safe_max_NeL2_all)

                minority_penalties = torch.zeros_like(NeL2_values)
                safe_max_NeL2_minority = max_NeL2_minority_samples if max_NeL2_minority_samples > 1e-6 else 1.0

                for i in range(len(NeL2_values)):
                    if is_minority_flags[i] and not correct_predictions[i]:
                        minority_penalties[i] = NeL2_values[i] / safe_max_NeL2_minority

                # Final sample weights
                sample_weights = sample_confidence + minority_penalties
                
                weighted_loss = (batch_ce_loss * sample_weights).mean()
                return weighted_loss
        ```

* **Vision Transformer (ViT)** (BO, Section 3.C):
    * Use a pre-built ViT from `timm` is highly recommended. Example: `vit_base_patch16_224`.
        ```python
        import timm
        def get_vit_model(num_classes=5, pretrained=True):
            # BO vit_config: image_size: 224, patch_size: 16, num_classes: 5, dim: 768, depth: 12, heads: 12, mlp_dim: 3072
            # This matches vit_base_patch16_224
            model_name = 'vit_base_patch16_224'
            vit_model = timm.create_model(model_name, pretrained=pretrained, num_classes=num_classes, in_chans=3)
            # Default in_chans=3. If 1-channel spectrograms are used before repeating to 3:
            # vit_model = timm.create_model(model_name, pretrained=pretrained, num_classes=num_classes, in_chans=1)
            return vit_model
        ```
    * Adaptation for 1-channel vs 3-channel: The `extract_stft_spectrogram_eeg` already outputs 3-channel by repeating. If it were to output 1-channel, `in_chans=1` would be set in `timm.create_model`.

* **Decision-Level Fusion (for MHA-GCN\_ViT)** (MHA-GCN ViT Paper, Section 3.5):
    * Formula: $P_i = \epsilon_1 \cdot m_i + \epsilon_2 \cdot n_i + \epsilon_3 \cdot v_i$.
    * $m_i, n_i, v_i$ are probability outputs from three model paths. The paper diagram (Fig 1) suggests:
        * Path 1 (EEG DWT): MHA-GCN -> $m_i$
        * Path 2 (EEG STFT): ViT -> $n_i$
        * Path 3 (Speech STFT/Mel): ViT -> $v_i$
    * $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \epsilon_3$ are weights. The paper mentions "weights are determined by the validation accuracy of each modality's features on the validation set."
    * During LOOCV, for each fold, the "training set" of 52 subjects can be further split into sub-train and sub-validation. The accuracies on this sub-validation set determine $\epsilon$ values for the test subject of that LOOCV fold. Or, they can be fixed based on average accuracies observed across folds/models. A simpler approach is to make them learnable or set them empirically (e.g., $\epsilon_1=\epsilon_2=\epsilon_3=1/3$ or tune them).
    * If validation accuracies are $acc_1, acc_2, acc_3$, then $\epsilon_j = acc_j / (acc_1+acc_2+acc_3)$.
        ```python
        class Combined_MHA_GCN_ViT(nn.Module):

### **5. Training and Validation Loop Logic** üîÅ

* **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**:
    * Outer loop: `for test_subject_idx in range(NUM_SUBJECTS):`
    * `train_subject_indices = [i for i in range(NUM_SUBJECTS) if i != test_subject_idx]`
    * `test_subject_indices = [test_subject_idx]`
    * Prepare data for these sets. Each "sample" for training/testing will be a 2s window (for features like DE, STFT for ViT) or a sequence of 180 2s windows (for DWT features for MHA-GCN if that interpretation is used).
    * **DepL-GCN Sample Confidence within LOOCV**:
        * `LeL2_storage`: Re-initialized for each LOOCV training fold. It's a dictionary mapping `(fold_id, sample_id_within_fold)` to its list of `eL2` values across epochs of that fold's training.
        * `conf_start_epoch`: e.g., `int(0.4 * NUM_EPOCHS)` or a fixed number like 40. (BO, Section 7.3; DepL-GCN Paper, Section III.E implies confidence calculation starts after some epochs). The DepL-GCN paper actual text says "After the model has been trained for a certain number of epochs (e.g., 40-60 epochs), the $NeL_2$ values for each sample tend to stabilize." It's when to *trust* $NeL_2$ for weighting. The $eL_2$ and $LeL_2$ are calculated from epoch 1.

* **Batch Processing**:
    * `BATCH_SIZE = 4` (BO, Section 4.5).
    * DataLoaders will yield batches of EEG windows/segments.
    * If MHA-GCN path expects features from 180 windows, one item in a batch for this path would be data from 180 windows.

* **Optimizer and Loss**:
    * Optimizer: `torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)` (BO, Section 4.5).
    * Loss: `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` or `nn.NLLLoss()` if model outputs log-softmax. For DepL-GCN, use the `DepLCustomLoss`.

* **Metrics Calculation & Aggregation**:
    * Per fold: `accuracy_score`, `precision_score(average='macro')`, `recall_score(average='macro')`, `f1_score(average='macro')`, `confusion_matrix`.
    * Store these for each fold.
    * Final results: Average the scores (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) across all folds. Sum confusion matrices.

### **6. Interactive Visualization - Concrete Definitions** üìä

* **Channel Selector (`channel_dropdown`)**:
    * Options: `CHANNELS_29` (BO, Section 1).
    * Behavior: When a channel is selected:
        * Display its raw EEG signal for a sample 2s window from a loaded subject (e.g., `epochs.get_data()[0, CHANNELS_29.index(selected_channel), :]`). Plot using Plotly.
        * Display its Power Spectral Density (PSD) for that window using Plotly (calculated via Welch's method).
        * Display its Differential Entropy values across the 5 `FREQ_BANDS` for that window.

* **Real-time Metrics Display (`metrics_display`)**:
    * This won't be truly "real-time" in a static notebook but will update based on selected data.
    * Content:
        * Current Subject ID being viewed.
        * Selected EEG window number (if applicable).
        * For a selected channel (from `channel_dropdown`):
            * Calculated DE values (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma).
        * If a model is loaded and prediction is run on the sample window:
            * Model's predicted depression level (e.g., 'Mild').
            * Probability scores for each depression level.
    * Mechanism: Updates when a new subject/window/channel is selected via widgets.

* **Model Comparison Matrix (`comparison_heatmap`)**:
    * Rows: Models (e.g., "DepL-GCN", "MHA-GCN\_ViT", "Baseline CNN").
    * Columns: Metrics (e.g., "Overall Accuracy", "F1-Normal", "F1-Mild", "F1-Moderate", "F1-Mod-Major", "F1-Major"). Per-class F1 for multi-class.
    * Cell Values: The scores achieved by each model for each metric (averaged from LOOCV).
    * Data Source: Populate from the stored LOOCV results.

* **2D Brain Topography (`mne.viz.plot_topomap`)**:
    * Data to plot:
        * Average DE power for a selected frequency band (e.g., alpha) for the current subject (averaged over all their windows or a specific window).
        * Or average PSD in a band.
    * `pos` (channel locations):
        ```python
        # CHANNELS_29 should be available
        # Need to filter the standard montage to only these 29 channels.
        standard_montage = mne.channels.make_standard_montage('standard_1020')
        
        # Create a new DigMontage for the selected 29 channels
        # Get positions for the 29 channels
        ch_positions_dict = {}

        for ch_name in CHANNELS_29:
            try:
                idx_in_montage = standard_montage.ch_names.index(ch_name)
                ch_positions_dict[ch_name] = standard_montage.dig[idx_in_montage]['r'] # 'r' is position
                present_channels_in_montage.append(ch_name)
            except ValueError:

                if ch_name == 'Fpz' and 'FPz' in standard_montage.ch_names:
                    idx_in_montage = standard_montage.ch_names.index('FPz')
                    ch_positions_dict['FPz'] = standard_montage.dig[idx_in_montage]['r']

                    idx_in_montage = standard_montage.ch_names.index('I1')
                    ch_positions_dict['I1'] = standard_montage.dig[idx_in_montage]['r']
                    present_channels_in_montage.append('I1')
                else:
                    print(f"Channel {ch_name} not found in standard_1020 montage. Will be excluded from topomap.")

        # Create a new montage for only the available channels among the 29
        # This requires channel names to match what plot_topomap expects via info object
        # It's easier to pass 'info' object to plot_topomap which contains the montage.
        # Create an MNE Info object for the 29 channels
        # Ensure data passed to plot_topomap is ordered according to info.ch_names
        
        # Example of creating info for plotting:
        # Assume `epochs` is an MNE Epochs object containing the 29 channels
        # info_29_channels = epochs.info 
        # data_for_topomap = ... # array of shape (n_channels_in_info,)
        # mne.viz.plot_topomap(data_for_topomap, info_29_channels, show=True)

        # If you only have positions and data array:
        # The data array must be in the same order as present_channels_in_montage
        # temp_info = mne.create_info(ch_names=present_channels_in_montage, sfreq=SAMPLING_RATE, ch_types='eeg')
        # custom_montage = mne.channels.make_dig_montage(ch_pos=ch_positions_dict, coord_frame='head')
        # temp_info.set_montage(custom_montage)
        # mne.viz.plot_topomap(data_for_topomap_ordered_like_present_channels, temp_info.get_montage().get_positions()['ch_pos'], show=True)
        # Or simpler: directly use mne.viz.plot_topomap(data, positions_array)
        # The `pos` argument to `plot_topomap` can be a 2D array of channel positions (n_channels, 2).
        # `mne.channels.find_layout(info).pos` can provide these 2D positions.
        ```
        The `pos` argument for `mne.viz.plot_topomap` should be obtained from an `mne.Info` object that has the montage set for the 29 channels.
        Example:
        `raw_picked = raw.copy().pick_channels(CHANNELS_29)`
        `info_for_topo = raw_picked.info`
        `channel_locations_2d = mne.channels.find_layout(info_for_topo).pos`
        `mne.viz.plot_topomap(data_array_ordered_like_info, channel_locations_2d, show=True)`

### **7. Implementation of Broader "Implementation Requirements"** üõ†Ô∏è

* **Model Comparison Framework**:
    * **Statistical Significance Testing**:
        * After LOOCV, you'll have F1 scores (or accuracies) per fold for each model.
        * Example: `f1_scores_model1` (list of 53 F1s), `f1_scores_model2` (list of 53 F1s).
        * Use `scipy.stats.ttest_rel(f1_scores_model1, f1_scores_model2)` for a paired t-test.
        * Report p-values.

* **Clinical Report Generation Module**:
    * **Content for a single subject (based on test result from LOOCV)**:
        * Subject ID.
        * True Depression Level (if available from MODMA metadata, based on PHQ-9 scores).
        * Predicted Depression Level (from the best performing model or a selected model).
        * Probability scores for each depression level from the model.
        * Key features: This is advanced. Could involve SHAP/LIME if models are suitable, or simpler feature importance if GCN/ViT allows (e.g., attention weights, average DE per band). For now, could list the average DE values for the key bands (e.g., alpha, beta) for that subject.
        * A representative 2D topomap (e.g., alpha band power).
    * **Output Format**: Formatted markdown string displayed in a notebook cell.
        ```python
        def generate_clinical_report_snippet(subject_id, true_level, pred_level, pred_probs,

    * `torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(42)`
    * `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` (can slow down, but good for reproducibility)
    * `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`

This detailed blueprint should provide a strong foundation for the AI coding agent. Key areas requiring extremely careful implementation or potential further clarification from domain experts include the exact formation of the `[15 features, 180 time steps]` DWT feature representation from a single 2s window and the specifics of ICA component removal without dedicated EOG/ECG channels.
