Clarity-AI Jupyter (MODMA EEG Sandbox) – Repository Audit

Scientific Fidelity of MODMA EEG Usage

The repository focuses on EEG-based depression classification using the MODMA dataset and generally follows methodologies seen in recent literature. Notably, it implements a Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) across all 53 subjects (24 diagnosed MDD patients, 29 healthy controls ￼) – a rigorous cross-subject evaluation strategy common in EEG depression studies. Labels are handled as binary (depressed vs. control), which is a simplification given that MODMA includes depression severity scores (PHQ-9) for multi-class analysis ￼. This binary approach is scientifically valid for an initial screening model, though advanced research like Zhang et al. (2025) has started tackling multi-class severity classification (five levels) using the same dataset ￼ ￼. In terms of feature methodology, the project aligns with state-of-the-art techniques: EEG time-frequency features and graph-based connectivity are leveraged similar to Liu et al. (2024)’s strategy, which combined multi-scale EEG features with channel-correlation graphs to achieve high depression prediction accuracy on MODMA ￼. For example, the code calculates per-channel Differential Entropy (DE) across standard frequency bands (delta through gamma) using the Welch PSD method ￼. This DE feature – defined as $0.5 \log(2\pi e \cdot \text{band power})$ – is consistent with features identified as useful EEG biomarkers in depression research ￼. Likewise, the inclusion of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features (15 coefficients per channel from a 5-level db4 wavelet) for graph nodes ￼ mirrors approaches in recent papers (e.g. extracting multi-scale complexity measures) and provides a richer representation of EEG temporal dynamics.

Overall, the dataset handling and feature engineering demonstrate good scientific fidelity. The code uses MNE-Python to load EEGLAB .set files (128 channels) and then selects 29 channels of interest (e.g. standard 10–20 leads and relevant electrodes) as defined in the config ￼ – a selection presumably based on prior studies’ channel subsets. This reduction to 29 channels is documented and aligns with the project blueprint ￼. Key preprocessing steps, however, appear minimal in the current implementation. There is no explicit band-pass filtering or artifact removal in the code we reviewed – for instance, no call to MNE’s filtering or ICA functions was found. Best practices from literature suggest band-pass filtering (approximately 1–40 Hz) to remove DC drifts and high-frequency noise, and applying ICA or regression to remove ocular artifacts ￼. These steps are mentioned in the design docs but not yet reflected in the repository’s preprocess_raw_data function (which is likely only doing channel picking and perhaps re-referencing). Ensuring proper filtering and artifact rejection would strengthen scientific rigor by aligning with how recent EEG depression studies pre-process data ￼. Without these, the model may be learning noise or subject-specific artifacts (e.g. eye blinks), which can hurt generalization.

Another aspect of scientific fidelity is fairness and bias considerations. The repository currently does not include any fairness analysis or bias mitigation, which is understandable for a first-pass research sandbox. However, it’s worth noting that algorithmic fairness in depression detection has been identified as an emerging concern – a 2025 study by Kwok et al. is “the very first attempt to evaluate machine learning fairness for depression detection using EEG” ￼. In practice, this means future enhancements might evaluate whether the models perform equally well across demographic subgroups (e.g. gender, age) or if there is any bias in false positives/negatives. While the MODMA dataset’s documentation would need to provide demographic metadata, aligning with these new fairness guidelines could involve computing group-specific metrics or incorporating techniques (like re-sampling or adversarial debiasing) to ensure the model is equitable. In summary, the project is scientifically on-track in terms of leveraging established EEG features and evaluation methods, but it should eventually integrate the preprocessing and fairness considerations now prevalent in cutting-edge research to maximize scientific fidelity.

Tools, Libraries, and Environment

The choice of tools and libraries in this repository is excellent and in line with widely adopted AI/ML and neuroscience packages. It uses Python 3.10+ in a JupyterLab environment, with core dependencies including: MNE-Python for EEG data handling, NumPy/Pandas/SciPy for numerical computing, Matplotlib/Seaborn for plotting, Scikit-Learn for classical ML metrics, and PyTorch (with Torchvision/Torchaudio) for deep learning ￼. These are industry-standard libraries – MNE is a go-to toolkit for EEG preprocessing/analysis, and PyTorch is a top deep learning framework – ensuring that any top-tier AI/ML researcher will be comfortable with the stack. The environment is also equipped with ipywidgets for interactivity and tqdm for progress bars, which are nice touches for user experience. The repository even includes pywavelets (PyWT) for wavelet transforms and scikit-image (used here for spectrogram resizing), indicating a thoughtful inclusion of domain-specific tools.

From a compatibility and modularity standpoint, the project is structured as a Python package (clarity module under src/) with a clear requirements.txt. The use of a pyproject.toml suggests the environment can be installed as a package, and indeed the code is written in a modular way that could be reused beyond notebooks. This is a strong positive for enabling rapid prototyping – researchers can either run the provided Jupyter notebook/script or import functions in their own notebooks. The environment setup instructions in the README (use of venv, pip installing requirements) are straightforward ￼. One improvement here would be pinning exact package versions in requirements.txt (currently versions are not specified). Locking versions (or providing a conda environment file) would ensure that the sandbox remains stable and reproducible, avoiding surprises from future library updates.

In terms of additional tools, a few high-quality libraries could further enhance the sandbox if integrated carefully:
 • PyTorch Geometric (PyG) or DGL: Given the use of graph convolutional networks, incorporating a dedicated geometric deep learning library would provide optimized graph layers and batching capabilities. The repository currently implements a custom GCN layer (SimpleGCNConv) manually ￼ ￼. While this is adequate for small graphs (29 nodes) and one-at-a-time processing, PyG would allow leveraging well-tested GCN, GAT, etc., and handle multiple graphs in a batch, potentially speeding up training. Experienced researchers might expect PyG for any extensive GCN work, though adding it means an extra dependency and some refactoring of the training loop.
 • Braindecode or MOABB: These EEG-focused libraries (Braindecode for deep learning, MOABB for benchmarks) are popular in academic EEG ML research. For example, Braindecode implements EEG-specific network architectures (like EEGNet, Deep4, etc.) and could be used to quickly try alternative models on the MODMA data. MOABB provides pipelines to evaluate algorithms across EEG datasets. While not strictly necessary, referencing known architectures like EEGNet (a compact CNN for EEG) could serve as strong baselines. Integrating an EEGNet implementation (either via braindecode or custom code) would be a valuable addition to compare against the current Baseline CNN.
 • Fairness and ML Ops libraries: If fairness analysis is a goal, libraries like Fairlearn or IBM’s AIF360 offer ready-made metrics and bias mitigation algorithms. They could be used to compute fairness metrics (e.g. demographic parity, equal opportunity) on the model’s predictions if demographic labels are available. On the MLOps side, tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases could be introduced for experiment tracking, but this might be overkill for a sandbox environment. Top researchers often use such tools for experiment logging and model versioning, though in a Jupyter sandbox context, lightweight tracking (even just CSV logging of results) might suffice.

Overall, the environment is highly compatible and modular. The use of timm (Torchvision Image Models) is notable – it’s included in requirements ￼ and presumably intended for leveraging pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) or other CNNs. In the current code, the ViT for EEG/speech isn’t fully implemented, but having timm ready means the sandbox can easily pull a ResNet or ViT model with one line of code. This forward-thinking inclusion caters to quickly experimenting with state-of-the-art models, which is exactly what a high-quality sandbox should enable. One suggestion would be to remove any truly unused dependencies to keep the environment lean – for example, if torchaudio isn’t used (unless planning to integrate the audio modality), it could be dropped. Likewise, if timm remains unused in the near-term, documenting its purpose or removing it until needed might avoid confusion. In summary, the repository’s toolset is robust, widely adopted, and well-suited for rapid AI/ML experimentation on EEG data. A few strategic additions (graph libraries, EEGNet, etc.) could further align it with what expert researchers expect in their toolbox.

Code Structure and Notebook Clarity

The codebase is organized in a logical, modular structure that separates concerns – a design that greatly enhances clarity and maintainability. The main analysis resides in a Jupyter notebook-script (notebooks/clarity_eeg_analysis.py), which is written as a Python script with special Jupytext markup so it can be opened either as a notebook or run as regular Python ￼. This approach is modern and convenient: it keeps the notebook under version control nicely and enables running the analysis in VSCode or JupyterLab seamlessly. Within this script, the workflow is broken into labeled sections (cells) that correspond to the typical pipeline: Imports and configuration, Setup (seeding and device), Main LOOCV loop, Results aggregation, and an Interactive visualization section ￼ ￼ ￼. Each section has a markdown comment header explaining its purpose, which is helpful for navigation. The use of inline comments and print statements further clarifies what each step is doing (e.g., printing the fold number, training progress, etc.).

Importantly, much of the heavy-lifting is abstracted into the src/clarity package. This means the notebook remains relatively concise (~170 lines) and reads more like a high-level experimental script, with details hidden in well-documented modules:
 • Data handling is in clarity/data/modma.py (functions like load_subject_data, preprocess_raw_data, segment_data).
 • Feature computation is in clarity/features.py (functions calculate_de_features, extract_dwt_features, etc., each with docstrings ￼ ￼).
 • Model definitions in clarity/models/ (e.g., BaselineCNN, MHA_GCN classes, both with clear forward definitions ￼ ￼).
 • Training loop utilities in clarity/training/loop.py (the CustomEEGDataset class and train_model/evaluate_model functions) ￼ ￼.

This structure is quite modular and mirrors a production code organization more than a typical single notebook. For a sandbox aiming to be “high-quality”, this is beneficial: researchers can modify or extend specific parts (say, swap in a different model in clarity/models/) without cluttering the main notebook. It also encourages good practices like reuse and testing of components in isolation. The presence of config constants (all hyperparameters and settings in one file config.py ￼ ￼) is another positive for clarity – it centralizes experiment settings (number of subjects, channels list, window size, epochs, learning rate, etc.), making it easy to review or adjust them.

Reproducibility is explicitly addressed. The code sets a random seed (42) for NumPy and PyTorch at the start ￼, and even enforces deterministic CUDA convolution behavior (by disabling CuDNN benchmarking) to ensure consistent results run-to-run ￼. This attention to seeding is crucial for researchers who want to trust that changes in results are due to model changes, not random variation. Additionally, the LOOCV procedure itself yields a full distribution of performance across subjects, which is more informative than a single train/test split. The notebook prints out each fold’s result and then the average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 with standard deviations ￼, providing a sense of variability. To further improve reproducibility, the repository might consider saving the fold-by-fold results (e.g., to a CSV or JSON) as part of the run – currently, results are only printed to stdout. Logging these would allow later analysis (for example, identifying which subjects were misclassified) without rerunning the entire experiment.

As for clarity, the existing markdown annotations are helpful but somewhat sparse. The README gives a brief introduction to the project and how to run it, but the notebook itself could use more explanatory text in Markdown cells to guide the reader through the analysis logic. For instance, a short description above the LOOCV loop explaining “we train on 52 subjects and test on the held-out subject for each iteration, to evaluate model generalization to unseen individuals” would reinforce understanding. Similarly, comments about why two model options (‘cnn’ vs ‘mha_gcn’) are provided, or what the interactive topomap is showing, would benefit less experienced users. Right now, a knowledgeable user can infer these from context, but explicit statements make the sandbox more welcoming. This is a minor suggestion – overall the notebook is clean and not overly verbose, which many will appreciate.

One small design choice is that the entire LOOCV process happens in one giant loop (one cell) that could potentially run for a long time (53 folds × 100 epochs each). This is logically fine, but in a Jupyter context it means you don’t see any output (besides tqdm progress) until the whole loop finishes each fold. The code does print intermediate messages each fold, which helps keep track of progress. An alternative design could be to structure it such that results are computed and stored, then analyzed in a separate cell – but this might complicate the flow. The current single-pass script approach is still acceptable for a sandbox, as it prioritizes automation (just “Run All” to get final results). Researchers looking to interact more might break out parts of the loop for iterative development (e.g., run one fold to debug, or visualize data for one subject). The modular code allows this – one can manually call load_subject_data or CustomEEGDataset in a separate cell if needed to inspect the data pipeline for a single subject.

In terms of notebook outputs and results clarity: the code prints summary metrics and provides an interactive topomap plot for Differential Entropy features across the scalp ￼ ￼. This topographic visualization (using mne.viz.plot_topomap) is a great feature for a research sandbox, as it lets users explore how power in different frequency bands distributes over channels for a sample subject. It adds interpretability to the pipeline, connecting model inputs (features) with neurophysiological meaning. One improvement would be to include a confusion matrix or per-fold performance breakdown in the results. Currently, we get average metrics (e.g. “Accuracy = X ± Y”), but a confusion matrix (especially if multi-class in future) or at least reporting sensitivity and specificity could provide more insight into errors (false positives vs false negatives). Given it’s binary classification now, a simple 2x2 confusion matrix aggregated over LOOCV would be easy to add using scikit-learn, and could be visualized with Seaborn heatmap for clarity.

Finally, a note on code quality: The repository uses Ruff and Pyright (listed in requirements ￼) for linting and type checking, indicating an emphasis on clean, type-safe code. The Python code we inspected was indeed PEP8-compliant and included type hints in function definitions, which reduces bugs and makes the code easier to understand (function signatures show expected types). This level of code hygiene is somewhat uncommon in research prototype code and speaks to the goal of making the sandbox high-quality. We encountered only a trivial issue (a minor detail: using zero_division="0" in metrics might be a typo – likely intended to be 0 as an integer – but it doesn’t affect functionality materially ￼). In conclusion, the project’s code structure and notebook are well-organized and quite clear, with just a few opportunities identified for adding explanatory context and small result visualizations to further improve clarity and reproducibility.

Alignment with Researcher Workflow and Repository Structure

The repository’s structure and provided utilities are largely in line with how an experienced AI/ML researcher in neuroscience would approach a new dataset, with a few notable strong points and a couple of areas that could be extended. Firstly, the presence of data loader functions and preprocessing utilities means that users don’t have to manually handle raw files each time – they can call load_subject_data(subject_id) and get an MNE Raw object or similar, which is exactly the kind of convenience that speeds up experimentation ￼. The segmentation of raw EEG into epochs (2-second windows with 50% overlap) is handled by segment_data() internally, abstracting that logic away from the user-facing code. This matches common practice: a researcher typically will prepare a dataset class or generator that yields preprocessed segments ready for modeling. Here, CustomEEGDataset plays that role, encapsulating the end-to-end data preparation for each subject/fold ￼ ￼. It even has logic to handle different model requirements (raw epoch data for CNN vs. DWT+graph for GCN) – this adaptive design is great for trying multiple modeling approaches on the same data.

The modular separation means an experienced user can delve deeper if needed (for example, if one suspects an issue in how adjacency matrices are computed, they can open features.py and inspect compute_adjacency_matrix ￼, which is much easier to locate than if it were buried inside the notebook code). The structure (clarity/data, clarity/features, clarity/models, clarity/training) is intuitive and mirrors the conceptual pipeline (data → features → model → training). This is likely to be appreciated by outside contributors or collaborators, as it imposes a logical order and avoids one giant script that does everything opaquely.

In terms of exploring a new dataset, researchers usually start with some exploratory data analysis (EDA) – e.g. plotting raw signals, looking at power spectra, maybe computing some basic statistics to get a feel for differences between groups. The current sandbox doesn’t have a dedicated EDA notebook, and the main script jumps fairly quickly into model training. To fully align with how a top-tier scientist might work, the repository could include a “data exploration” notebook or expand the existing one with a section that, for instance, plots an example EEG trace or the average band power for depressed vs control groups. Even without a separate notebook, a few initial cells (before modeling) could be added: e.g., visualizing one subject’s EEG (the code could use raw.plot() or plot PSD via MNE) and maybe a summary of dataset label distribution (like how many patients vs controls, which is currently only implicit in the code). This kind of contextual understanding is often important before diving into model training, to ensure there’s no data quality issue (bad channels, etc.) or to get insight into what features might be relevant (e.g., “depressed patients seem to have higher delta power on average” – a hypothesis one might form from EDA).

The repository structure already supports multi-modal exploration – for example, if one wanted to integrate the MODMA audio (speech) data, there’s a placeholder in the blueprint for it and tools like torchaudio are available. An experienced researcher might attempt to fuse EEG and audio to improve predictions (since MODMA includes both). Currently, the code doesn’t handle audio, but adding it wouldn’t break the structure; you could imagine adding clarity/data/audio.py and a new dataset class or extending CustomEEGDataset to also load audio features. The repository is therefore extensible, which is a sign of a healthy sandbox for experimentation. The overall file/folder layout (data/ for dataset, notebooks/, src/clarity, plus a docs/ archive of design notes) is tidy and typical of research code that might eventually become a product or larger project.

One potential misalignment with researcher workflow is efficiency in repeated experiments. As it stands, the LOOCV training loop will reload and re-preprocess the data from disk on each fold ￼. For 53 subjects and potentially hundreds of 2s epochs each, this results in a lot of redundant computation. A savvy researcher might prefer to load all subject data once, cache the features, and then just split those in each fold – especially when tweaking models and re-running experiments frequently. The current design favors simplicity over optimization, which is actually fine for a first version (avoid premature optimization). But to better serve rapid prototyping, providing an option to use cached data (perhaps by serializing per-subject feature tensors to disk after the first run, or keeping them in memory) would save time. This could be as simple as a flag in CustomEEGDataset like use_cache=True that stores results of load_subject_data -> preprocess -> segment -> features the first time and reuses them next time the subject is encountered. Researchers often iterate on model architecture and hyperparameters dozens of times, so shaving off waiting time (especially on data I/O and preprocessing) means faster cycles.

Another slight difference in workflow: the code currently doesn’t include hyperparameter tuning beyond using fixed defaults (batch size 4, 100 epochs, LR 0.001). Experienced ML scientists might use something like Optuna or at least grid search to tune these. While that might be outside the scope of an initial sandbox, the repository could be enhanced by demonstrating how to adjust these easily (since they are in config.py, one can simply edit them or override in the notebook). Perhaps a note in the README or comments that “you can experiment with hyperparameters in src/clarity/training/config.py” would encourage that. Additionally, for workflow, one could add a simple mechanism to train only on a subset of data or fewer epochs for quick tests. This isn’t critical, but for very large models or more modalities, a full LOOCV might become slow, and a researcher would appreciate ways to do a quick sanity check run (e.g., run just 5 epochs or use 5-fold CV instead of LOOCV to reduce folds).

Finally, it’s worth mentioning that the existing design exhibits minimal “architecture bloat.” The code is not overly engineered – it’s actually lean, given the ambitious blueprint. Many advanced features (like the multimodal fusion, the DepL-GCN loss components, etc.) appear to have been scoped out or left for future implementation, which is wise. The current repository is focused and functional, which is exactly what you want for a sandbox MVP (minimum viable product). There is no unnecessary abstraction or complex class hierarchy; everything has a clear purpose. This will make it easier for researchers to trust the code and modify it. For example, the BaselineCNN is a simple straightforward PyTorch nn.Module ￼ – if someone wants to try a different CNN, they can simply edit or replace that class. The MHA-GCN model is a bit more complex but still clearly structured and commented, with an understandable forward pass that one could extend (e.g., adding another GCN layer or a different graph readout) ￼ ￼.

In summary, the repository’s workflow and structure are well-aligned with research practices: data loading functions, configuration management, modular code, and a logical experiment pipeline. To further match the expectations of experienced researchers, the addition of an initial data exploration step, some caching/efficiency tweaks, and possibly a demonstrated path to extend to multimodal data would round it out. These would ensure that a user can go from exploring the raw data → extracting features → training models → evaluating results → interpreting findings all within this one environment, which is essentially the cycle of scientific discovery in applied ML.

Missing Features and Potential Enhancements

Despite its solid foundation, the repository could be enhanced with several components to elevate it into a “best-in-class” Jupyter sandbox for MODMA and similar datasets. Here we detail some missing features and how adding them would improve utility:
 • EEG Preprocessing Enhancements: As noted, implementing a proper band-pass filter (e.g. 1–40 Hz) on the raw EEG and performing artifact removal would be a significant improvement. Currently, if preprocess_raw_data is only doing minimal work, high-frequency muscle noise or low-frequency drift could contaminate features. Tools for this are readily available (MNE’s raw.filter() for band-pass, mne.preprocessing.ICA for blink artifacts). Including these steps would align with standard EEG pipeline recommendations ￼ and likely improve model performance by feeding cleaner data. Even a simpler step like excluding bad channels (if any are known or detected via high variance) could be beneficial – MNE can mark bad channels or interpolate them. Since this is a sandbox, one could make artifact handling configurable (e.g., turn ICA on/off via a flag, since ICA can be time-consuming). This gives flexibility depending on the user’s needs for speed vs. fidelity.
 • Class Imbalance and Multi-Class Handling: The project currently treats depression detection as binary classification. However, the dataset provides depression severity levels (PHQ-9 scores) which enable multi-class classification or regression. A best-in-class research environment might allow experimenting with predicting these levels (perhaps grouping into 5 classes: Normal, Mild, Moderate, etc., as defined in DEPRESSION_LEVELS config ￼). Implementing this would involve changing NUM_CLASSES to 5 and altering labels/metrics accordingly. It’s non-trivial because multi-class classification on 53 subjects (with imbalanced class counts) is challenging – indeed Zhang et al. (2025) addressed this via specialized techniques (sample confidence and minority class penalty) ￼. Incorporating at least some basic support for multi-class could set this sandbox apart. For example, one could include an alternate training loop or loss that uses class weights to handle imbalance. Or implement a simplified version of the DepL-GCN approach: e.g., add a “sample confidence” threshold – essentially filtering out training samples that the model finds highly confusing over epochs, which might correspond to mislabeled or ambiguous cases. While fully replicating DepL-GCN’s novel loss might overshoot the current scope, providing hooks for researchers to plug in such ideas (like a custom loss function or an easy way to adjust sample weighting) would be forward-looking.
 • Fairness and Metadata: To address the fairness aspect, the sandbox could incorporate an analysis of performance across subgroups. If MODMA’s metadata includes something like age, sex, or site of data collection, one could stratify the LOOCV results by these attributes. For example, “The model’s accuracy on female vs male patients” or “Does the model perform worse on older patients?”. Even if such attributes are not readily available, demonstrating how to evaluate fairness (perhaps by simulating a scenario or using another dataset’s info) would make the environment cutting-edge. Adding a few lines to compute and print metrics per subgroup (if labels are known) or to plot ROC curves for each group could raise awareness of bias issues. Additionally, if fairness mitigation is desired, one could integrate a simple re-sampling technique (like undersampling the majority group within each training fold or equalizing datasets by augmentation). Again, these would likely be optional or for exploration, since fairness in EEG is very new and dataset-dependent. Still, highlighting this potential is an enhancement for a “high-quality” research sandbox because it pushes users to consider more than just aggregate accuracy – a hallmark of thorough scientific inquiry.
 • Multimodal Integration (Wearable EEG/Speech): The name “Psychiatry Digital Twin” and initial project description hint at combining multiple data streams (EEG + another modality). MODMA includes a 3-lead wearable EEG recording taken simultaneously and also some audio recordings of subjects ￼ ￼. A top-tier sandbox would enable playing with these modalities. For instance, the repository could have an audio preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline using torchaudio/librosa to create spectrograms (Mel-spectrograms as mentioned in the design doc ￼ ￼). It could then use a pre-trained transformer or CNN (via timm or HuggingFace) to extract embeddings from those spectrograms. The multimodal model could either concatenate EEG and audio features or implement decision-level fusion (averaging the prediction probabilities from an EEG model and an audio model, as per some literature). While integrating this fully is a substantial task, even providing a stub or example notebook for the secondary modality would be a big value-add. For example, a notebook that compares EEG-only vs audio-only classification performance on the subset of subjects with both data would let researchers gauge the added value of the second modality. Given that the repo already has timm and mentions of ViT, it seems this was in the roadmap. Completing or sketching out this part would maximize MODMA’s potential as a multimodal open dataset.
 • Additional Models and Evaluation Techniques: Currently, two deep models are implemented – a simple 1D CNN and the MHA-GCN. This covers a baseline and a more advanced approach. There are a few missing model types that could be included for completeness: for example, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN/LSTM) or a Transformer that processes EEG time-series directly. Some recent works apply transformers to EEG sequences for classification. The sandbox could allow easy swapping of models. One idea: implement a generic interface or configuration where a user can specify MODEL_TO_RUN = 'cnn' | 'mha_gcn' | 'eegnet' | 'transformer' and easily plug in new classes. In fact, adding an EEGNet model class (which is just a few convolutional layers with depthwise convs – the architecture is well-known) could provide a strong baseline that likely outperforms the very basic CNN currently used, since EEGNet is designed for EEG signal spatial filtering. Moreover, including an SVM or Random Forest baseline on extracted features (like on DE features averaged per subject) might be informative – scikit-learn could train such a model quickly for comparison. While deep learning is the focus, classical ML could serve as a sanity check (e.g., “Can a simple linear SVM on bandpower features achieve 70%? If so, our complex model should beat that to be worthwhile.”). These additions would ensure the sandbox is not limited to the initially provided models but is a platform to explore a range of techniques.
 • Performance and Scalability: As mentioned, one missing aspect is optimizing the data pipeline for speed. The current approach of computing features on the fly for every fold is not scalable. If the dataset were larger or if one wanted to do repeated runs (for statistically robust results), it would become a bottleneck. A solution could be to precompute all subject features and save them (perhaps in NumPy .npz files or PyTorch tensors) under data/processed/. The training loop could detect if those exist and load them instead of recomputing. This adds complexity but massively speeds up repeated experiments. Another angle is leveraging GPU more: MNE’s filtering, wavelet transforms, etc., are CPU-bound in this pipeline. Using PyTorch (which can do convolutions as filtering) or CuPy for some operations could accelerate preprocessing if needed. However, unless the team plans to scale to much larger EEG datasets, the current performance might be acceptable (53 subjects is manageable). It’s something to keep in mind: a best-in-class setup would make efficient use of computational resources, so users spend time on modeling rather than waiting for data to load/prepare.
 • Results Interpretation and Visualization: Finally, an area of enhancement is how results are communicated. The interactive topomap is great for one type of insight (spatial distribution of a feature in a particular band). We could add more: for example, plotting the learned weights or saliency of the model. In an MHA-GCN, one could visualize the learned node attention weights – e.g., after training, for each graph (subject) perhaps extract the attention scores from the model’s multi-head attention layer and see which channels (nodes) had higher attention for depressed vs control. This could highlight which brain regions are most discriminative, contributing to explainability. The CNN model could be probed by looking at filter activations or using an input occlusion test to see which time segments or channels affect the prediction. These are advanced, but even a simpler approach like feature importance: since DE features (per channel per band) are used for the topomap, one could also compare the average DE values between classes and plot those. The sandbox could include a section that says “Let’s examine if any particular frequency band shows significant differences between depressed and control groups” by plotting, say, the distribution of alpha-band DE for all depressed vs all control segments. Such analysis connects the ML output back to scientific understanding, which is highly valuable in a psychiatry context. It ensures the sandbox isn’t just a black-box model trainer, but a tool for insight – a quality that top researchers appreciate (especially in healthcare, where interpretability is important).

In summary, the repository is missing some of these advanced components simply because it’s an initial version. Addressing them – preprocessing, multi-class/fairness considerations, multimodal data, additional baseline models, caching for efficiency, and richer visualizations – would transform it from a good research demo into a powerful experimentation platform. Each enhancement should be made carefully to avoid making the system brittle or overly complex, but even incremental additions in these areas would significantly boost usability and scientific rigor.

Recommendations and Next Steps

To elevate the repository to a best-in-class AI/ML EEG sandbox, we propose the following actionable steps, grouped by theme:
 • Data Preprocessing Improvements:
 • Integrate band-pass filtering (e.g. 1–40 Hz) on raw EEG data before feature extraction to remove irrelevant frequencies, as suggested in the project’s blueprint ￼. This will align the data with typical EEG practice and likely improve model signal-to-noise ratio.
 • Add artifact removal, such as an ICA step to remove eye-blink or ECG artifacts. MNE’s ICA class can identify artifactual components. Even if not run by default (due to time cost), providing an option or example to do this will increase confidence in the data’s quality.
 • Document or automate channel selection: The code uses a fixed list of 29 channels ￼. Ensure the data loader actually applies this selection (e.g., via raw.pick_channels(CHANNELS_29)) and maybe provide a rationale (in comments or docs) for these specific channels (e.g., “These cover standard 10-20 locations and exclude peripheral channels to reduce noise”). Researchers unfamiliar with MODMA will then understand they’re not accidentally ignoring data.
 • Efficiency and Workflow:
 • Implement caching of processed data. For instance, after computing epochs and features for a subject, save them to disk (as NumPy arrays or PyTorch tensors). Subsequent LOOCV folds can load these, avoiding redundant computation. This could cut down total runtime significantly. As a simple approach, one could serialize the CustomEEGDataset.data for each subject to a file when first created. Alternatively, maintain a module-level cache (a dictionary of subject_id -> features) within data.modma functions.
 • Allow configurable run settings. Expose in the notebook (or config) some knobs like EPOCHS and perhaps a DEBUG_MODE (for instance, to run only 2 folds or use fewer epochs for quick testing). Top-tier researchers often like to do a fast iteration before committing to a full LOOCV run. You could implement, for example: if DEBUG_MODE: subjects = subjects[:5] to train on a subset, or an argument to train_model to break early. Making it easy to toggle such settings (and clearly indicating how in the notebook) will improve usability.
 • Parallelize where possible. While PyTorch will utilize multiple cores and GPU for model training, some preprocessing (Welch’s PSD, wavelet transforms) might be parallelized across channels or windows using Python’s joblib or multiprocessing. If loading all subjects at once, consider using DataLoader with num_workers to fetch and process windows in parallel. This can be tricky with MNE objects, but converting to NumPy early can help leverage parallelism.
 • Model and Pipeline Enhancements:
 • Include additional baseline models. We recommend adding an EEGNet implementation (a well-known compact CNN for EEG) as an alternative to BaselineCNN. EEGNet is proven in many brain-signal tasks and could provide a strong baseline above the current simple CNN (which achieved ~50% per the blueprint ￼). Similarly, an RNN or Transformer-based model (even a one-layer LSTM on the time series, or a small ViT on spectrograms) could be added to widen the experimentation space.
 • Use pre-trained networks for spectrograms. If pursuing the ViT path, leverage timm to load a pre-trained vision transformer (or EfficientNet, etc.) and fine-tune it on EEG spectrogram images. This was indicated in the design (using a ViT for EEG and one for speech ￼) – implementing it would be cutting-edge. Ensure that if spectrogram-based models are added, the spectrogram extraction (currently via STFT in features.py ￼) is integrated into the pipeline. This might require adjusting CustomEEGDataset or creating a new dataset class for image inputs. Using pre-trained models can significantly boost performance for small data, so this is a high-impact enhancement.
 • Incorporate the DepL-GCN ideas for fairness/imbalance. Concretely, implement a sample confidence module: during training, keep track of the training samples that consistently yield high loss, and consider dropping or down-weighting them in later epochs (they might be noisy labels). This could be done by monitoring loss per sample (or per subject) and filtering out a percentage of “hard” examples as training progresses. Additionally, implement a minority class penalty if extending to multi-class: for example, increase the loss weight for under-represented class samples when they are misclassified. Even a simple version of this (using class weights in the loss function via CrossEntropyLoss(weight=...) for multi-class) can help ￼. These techniques, inspired by Zhang et al. (2025), would address label subjectivity and class imbalance, aligning the sandbox with the very latest research trends.
 • Results Analysis and Visualization:
 • Add confusion matrix and per-fold reporting. For binary classification, track the true/false positives and negatives across all folds and display a confusion matrix at the end (using sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix). For multi-class (if implemented), this becomes even more important. A heatmap of the confusion matrix provides an immediate sense of which classes are confused (e.g., moderate vs moderate-to-severe depression). This could be accompanied by printing fold-by-fold accuracies or plotting their distribution (boxplot), giving a sense of variability.
 • Integrate statistical significance tests or confidence intervals. With LOOCV results, one can compute the variance of metrics. You might incorporate a simple significance test: e.g., a paired t-test comparing the two models’ performance across the 53 folds, to see if MHA-GCN significantly outperforms the CNN. This kind of analysis elevates the scientific rigor and is something an experienced researcher might do to ensure gains are not by chance.
 • Enhance interpretability: Consider outputs that help explain model decisions. For the GCN, you could visualize the graph adjacency matrices or degree centrality for depressed vs control brains. For example, after training, compute the average adjacency (correlation graph) for all depressed subjects vs all controls and plot these as topographic graphs or matrices – are there connectivity differences? Similarly, since the MHA-GCN uses attention, you could extract the attention weights (the attn_output in MHA_GCN.forward ￼) to see which nodes (channels) had high weights. Plotting those as a topomap might highlight important electrodes. For the CNN or any model, you could apply occlusion tests: systematically zero out one channel or one time segment and see how the prediction changes, indicating importance of that segment. Providing these kinds of analyses (perhaps as optional notebook sections) will turn the sandbox into a learning tool that not only builds models but also yields insights into why the model makes its predictions – a crucial aspect in clinical applications like this.
 • Documentation and Usability:
 • Improve in-notebook documentation. Expand the Markdown cells in the notebook to provide more commentary on each step’s purpose and any relevant background. For instance, explain what “Differential Entropy” means in the context of EEG and why it’s useful for depression classification (citing a source if possible), or describe LOOCV in a sentence for those who might not know it. This makes the notebook educational for newcomers and ensures even seasoned researchers don’t misinterpret what’s being done.
 • Update the README with results and references. Currently, the README explains how to run the analysis ￼. It could be enriched with a summary of findings (e.g., “Preliminary LOOCV accuracy ~X% with CNN, ~Y% with MHA-GCN”) and references to the papers that inspired the models. Listing a few key references (like the ones from the docs/ folder ￼ ￼) in the README or a separate REFERENCES.md shows that the implementation is grounded in research. It also helps users who want to read more about the methods.
 • Ensure environment stability: after adding any new major features (e.g., PyTorch Geometric for GCN), test the environment installation from scratch. Possibly provide a environment.yml for conda users. Given this is meant as a sandbox for others, you want setup to be as painless as possible. Including JupyterLab extensions like jupyterlab-lsp (for IDE-like features) or nbgitpuller (for easy cloud deployment) in docs as optional steps could also help those aiming to use this on a server or cloud service.

By implementing these recommendations, the repository will become a comprehensive platform for rapid, rigorous experimentation on the MODMA EEG dataset. The emphasis is on making it easy to try out new ideas (new models, modalities, fairness strategies) and to thoroughly investigate results (through robust evaluation and visualization). Each suggestion above is geared toward maximizing the dataset’s potential within realistic bounds of current science – for example, multi-class EEG depression detection and multimodal fusion are active research areas in 2024-2025, so integrating those keeps the sandbox at the cutting edge without venturing into speculation. Adopting these improvements should greatly increase the repository’s appeal and usefulness to top-tier AI/ML scientists and clinicians working on psychiatry “digital twin” models, accelerating research while maintaining scientific rigor.
